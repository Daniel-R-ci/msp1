                    also enjoys the task of switching freight cars to the correct destination. The modeler who built

                <p>This makes it a great little home layout for one who doesn't have much space, but it's constructed
                    to also be able to bring to module meetings where it becomes part of a much larger plan.</p>

                <p>These days you can learn a lot of different skills by watching Youtube channels (and there are quite
                    a lot of good ones out there,
                    check or resources page for some), but there are few substitutes from seeing in real life how others
                    have come up with different solutions to various aspects.</p>
                <p> None of us can be an expert of everything, but there are always people there
                    willing to show how they have done and give a helping hand when needed. Maybe you are thinking of
                    something no one has done before, but then you have a "think tank" of friends
                    to help you brainstorm and try out your plans.</p>
                <p>There is also little bit of healthy peer preasure, you want to have something new to show at the next
                    meeting. Maybe planting those trees behind the tracks that you thought of for so long?</p>

                <p>What do you do then when you have built your module and modules and bring them to a meeting?
                    Well, that is in i big part up to you and what you want.</p>
                <p>Some wants to run trains in a realistic fashion, something called operations. There are many
                    different levels to this, some construct a time table and run trains with a fast clock. Others use
                    different kinds of cards and lists to make sure every freight car gets to a specified location.
                    It doesn't have to be harder than an instruction like "Take the empty coal hoppers to the mine,
                    exchange them with loaded cars and return to yard with the loaded cars". The first time at a meeting
                    that focuses on operations, there is always someone there to guide you and help you get started.</p>
                <p>Others find operations stressfull, or not just interesting, and just want to see trains running
                    through different scenes. Those meetings exist too, or a meeting can combine operations with what is
                    often called "free running".</p>
                <p>Other meetings or shows exist for the purpose of showing the hobby to the public. A club can choose
                    to participate in a show or a fair to let visitors see trains running and to explain the concept of
                    modules.

                <p>Building modules isn't just about trains and "playing with them". It can also be an outlet for
                    creativity, arts, electronics, history and much more. Some modelers have duplicated memories from
                    long gone eras, like their childhood village.
                    In this Youtube clip from our Youtube Channel, you can see not just trains but also ships moving and
                    actually passing a lock to reach inland destination, a tribute to the importance of naval shipping
                    both in history and present days.
